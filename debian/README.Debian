mochiweb for Debian
-------------------

To have your mochiweb projects automatically launched by the init.d
script, you create files in /etc/mochiweb/apps, each of which contains
one line, the directory of its application.

For instance:

    /etc/mochiweb/apps/foobar

Which contains

    /var/www/foobar/

Which was created with the 'new_mochiweb' script:

    new_mochiweb foobar /var/www
